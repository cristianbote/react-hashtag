const Card = () => (

        Here goes my card contents with #static text inside
    </p>
);

// Will become
import ReactHashtag from "react-hashtag";

const Card = () => (
    <p>
        <ReactHashtag>
            Here goes my card contents with #static text inside
        </ReactHashtag>
    </p>
);
```

## Install
The usual flow

```bash
npm install react-hashtag --save
```

## Api
The component `ReactHashtag` is actually pretty generic. Is not something that someone can't do in half an hour. But, this one has some generic API that could make you turn.

| Name | Type | Description
| ---- | ---- | -----------
| renderHashtag(value: String, onClick: Function) | function | Returns the custom element to be renderer instead of a `<span>`. You can go wild here.
| onHashtagClick(value: String, e: Event) | function | The click handler for each hashtags. This will be called with the hashtag value that got clicked.
| hashtagRegex(value: Regex) | Regex | Here user can provide the custom regex. According to  this regex matched values will be enclosed in `<span>`.


## Examples

### Custom renderer
```jsx harmony
const Card = (props) => (
    <p>
        <ReactHashtag
            renderHashtag={(hashtagValue) => (
                <div className="hashtag">{hashtagValue}</div>
            )}
        >
            {props.children}
        </ReactHashtag>
    </p>
);
```

### With Custom Hashtag Regex Prop
```jsx harmony

const Card = (props) => (
    <p>
        <ReactHashtag
            hashtagRegex={/(?:(?<=\s)|^)#(\w*[a-zA-z]\w*)+\b(?!#)/gm}
        >
            {props.children}
        </ReactHashtag>
    </p>
);
```

### With styled components
```jsx harmony

const Hashtag = styled.span`
    color: tomato;
`;

const Card = (props) => (
    <p>
        <ReactHashtag
            renderHashtag={(hashtagValue) => (
                <Hashtag>{hashtagValue}</Hashtag>
            )}
        >
            {props.children}
        </ReactHashtag>
    </p>
);
```

### Reusable or composition 
You could reuse the same definition, if that's something you're looking for. The following example uses the anchor and defines a component that will redirect to certain hashtag pages.
```jsx harmony
const StyledHashtag = styled.a`
    color: tomato;
`;

/**
* Custom component to render the hashtags with a custom renderer
*/
const Hashtags = (props) => (
    <ReactHashtag
        renderHashtag={(hashtagValue) => (
            <StyledHashtag
                href={`/search/${hashtagValue}`}
            >
                {hashtagValue}
            </StyledHashtag>
        )}
    >
        {props.children}
    </ReactHashtag>
);

const Card = (props) => (
    <p>
        <Hashtags>
            {props.children}
        </Hashtags>
    </p>
);
```
